This is a simple Serverless app designed to work with a lambda function deployed using AWS and simplified with Netlify.

**Functionalities:** Views GitHub Users.

I am using **Node Lambda**, bootstrap (CSS framework) and **AWS** at the Backend.

This architecture secures your API Client Secret ( w/ Netlify )

* `git clone https://github.com/RohitoOo/serverless_netlify.git` - Clone this repo
* `cd into root directory` - Access Root Directory
